* Spencerian script
Spencerian Script is a script styled developed by Platt Rogers Spencer in 1840.  His script was based on already existing scripts, inspired by the shapes found in nature, resulting in a unique oval-based penmanship style that could be written very quickly and legibly.  For the first time you didn't have to lift your pen 

From 1850 to 1925, Spencerian Script was the de facto writing style for business correspondence in the United States of America.  It was the first longhand where you didn't have to lift your hand in the middle of words and was both rapid and highly legible.  In the 1920's the growing popularity of the typewriter rendered it obsolete as the primary means of written communication in business.
